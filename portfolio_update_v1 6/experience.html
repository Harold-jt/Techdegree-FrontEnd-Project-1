        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h3>United States Army- E-5 Sergeant</h3>
        <p>My role as a sergeant in the United States Army solidified my leadership skills as I led teams of up to 150 soldiers in a fast-paced, dynamic work environment.  </p>
        <p>Through consistent and intense training, I have gained a comprehensive background in leadership, strategic planning, risk management, and critical thinking. The Army gave me the necessary training in how to develop strategic plans as well as implement these plans.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <h3>Liberty University- Bachelor of Science</h3>
        <p>The Bachelor of Science in Religion gave me solid instruction on fundamental principles of the Bible, Christianity, theology, and the church. It equipped me to apply Biblical components and principles to many contemporary issues facing society today.  </p>
        <p>From this degree, I have developed exceptional written and oral communication skills that have benefited me both personally and professionally. This has allowed me to gain insight into the major issues, themes, and ideas of religious studies, and this is why I am prepared for diverse vocational opportunities.</p>
